# OLD Tutorial Video (v1.x.x)

:::warning
This is a tutorial video recorded by Gato (creepycats) and uploaded by CleaningLynx for VoidMod v1.X.X

I highly recommend you watch this, but DO NOT follow along to the Blueprints as VoidMod2 completely rewrites the functions shown in the video to be separate from the VoidMod instance.

The video is unedited and encompasses everything you would need to know in VoidMod before VoidMod2
