# Installing the Devkit
:::note Dr. Dee's Note
These guides is meant for individuals who want to start creating mods using the VoidMod2 framework.
:::
The VoidMod development kit provides a host of useful tools and assets for getting started with modding VotV.

Inside, you can find:
- The VoidMod framework, which provides easy access to many of VotV's variables and functions, and allowing mods to easily save their configs.
- An example mod, `SampleBananaCat`, which modders can use to take inspiration from or to play around with.
- [VotV ghostmappings](https://github.com/NynrahGhost/VotV_ghostmapping/releases), created by NynrahGhost, which mimics VotV's own assets, making it easy for modders reference VotV's objects with their own mods.

## Installing the VoidMod2 Development Kit
:::warning
Make sure your Unreal Engine project is closed while making these changes.
:::
VoidMod2 Development Kit is currently only available in the [EternityDev Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/eternitydevgames), and new releases are posted in The [VoidMod Thread](https://discord.com/channels/512287844258021376/1135662233460949002).

Extract the contents to the `VotV/Content/` folder in your project.

```
📁 VotV
    📄 VotV.uproject
    📁 Plugins
    📁 Config
    📁 Content
      📄 Zip Contents Go Here...
```

Finally, re-open the VotV Unreal Engine Project, and check to see if you have a "Mods" folder. If you do, congratulations!
