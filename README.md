# VotV Modding Wiki
A wiki for modding the game [Voices of the Void](https://mrdrnose.itch.io/votv) by [MrDrNose](https://mrdrnose.itch.io/), built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

This wiki is heavily based on the original [VotV modding wiki](https://modding.ariral.space/), written by Gato/creepycats. Unfortunately, the source files for that wiki became unavailable, which made editing or contributing to the wiki impossible. This is what eventually necessitated the creation of this wiki.

**This project is a work of my own and is unofficial.**

## Contributing
Any form of contributing is welcomed and greatly appreciated!

ðŸ¥‰ For smaller recommendations or those without experience writing, helpers can also help suggest changes or tweaks through the contact methods provided [below](#contact).

ðŸ¥ˆ For less technically-experienced writers, contributors can write their own pages or test out writing different things using any markdown editor [like this one](https://markdownlivepreview.com/). Any finished pages you've written can be DM'ed or written to me using my discord or email provided [below](#contact).

ðŸ¥‡ For more technically experienced users, I would recommend [running the wiki locally](#running-locally), and submitting their edits through pull requests.

Feel free to contact me even if you're not as sure about your suggestion! Contact me even if you just want to bounce ideas off of me!

## Running Locally
Docusaurus is designed to be runnable locally with a webserver that updates live to any changes you make to the code. Here are directions for setting-up and launching the wiki on a local computer. These directions are paraphrased from the installation directions found in the [docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation).

### Requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 18.0 or above, with npm included
- The downloaded repository. You can download it by:
  - Downloading it as a `.zip` file using the green code button on the GitHub website.
  - Cloning the repository using the `git clone https://github.com/Questwalker/votv-modding-wiki` command.

### Setup:
1. Open a command prompt or powershell, and navigate to the folder using `cd` or a similar method.
2. Download and setup the dependencies for the project by running `npm ci`. Wait until it is done running to continue.
3. Finally, run `npm start` to start the web server. It should automatically build the website and open a new tab in your browser with the wiki. Any changes you make to the wiki's files should update on that website in real time. Press `Ctrl+C` in the command prompt to shut down the server at any time.
