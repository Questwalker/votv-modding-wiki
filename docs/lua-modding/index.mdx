# Lua Modding
This section of the wiki outlines how to make mods for the game using Lua scripting.

This part of the wiki is still in development! In the mean time, check out the [Palworld modding wiki](https://pwmodding.wiki/) and the [UE4SS's lua modding section](https://docs.ue4ss.com/lua-api.html) for help.
