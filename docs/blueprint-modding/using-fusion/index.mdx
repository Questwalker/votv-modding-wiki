# Using Fusion
**Fusion** is a tool that allows modders to modify some aspects of VotV like datatables, input events, and assets. It can be found as a mod on Thunderstore, and doesn't require any special installation from modders to use.

## Notice
This wiki does not include everything you can do with Fusion, check out the README included on the mod's [Thunderstore Page](https://thunderstore.io/c/voices-of-the-void/p/NynrahGhost/Fusion/) and watch the official video to get a full grasp of Fusion capabilities.
