# Getting the UE4SS.log
This is a page explaining how to get the `UE4SS.log` file. This file is useful for getting certain information or diagnosing certain issues with the modloader.

## Where to find it
The log file is located within the `\VotV\Binaries\Win64` folder of your VotV installation. You will find it alongside some other files like the `VotV-Win64-Shipping.exe`.

<!-- :::warning
This file will include information about your timezone and the name of your computer's username (`C:\Users\<USERNAME>`).\
If you are going to share this log file anywhere (this might be asked when looking for support in the public Discord), and you care about censoring these values, then make sure to find/replace them before sharing the file.
