# Useful Tools for Modding

## General Modding

- [RE-UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS)
  - Enables modding for Unreal Engine Games. Check its [Documentation Here](https://docs.ue4ss.com/dev/index.html)
- [UnrealShimloader](https://thunderstore.io/c/voices-of-the-void/p/Thunderstore/unreal_shimloader/)
  - A Fork of RE-UE4SS, designed to support Mod Managers and Custom Mod Paths.
- [VoidMod](https://thunderstore.io/c/voices-of-the-void/p/Gatohost/VoidMod/)
  - A Blueprint framework mod, allowing for simple Custom Props, Events, and interacting with the Base Game
  - You can Download the Development Kit (A .zip archive of Unreal Engine Assets containing the framework and examples) in the [EternityDev Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/eternitydevgames), under the [VoidMod Loader Thread](https://discord.com/channels/512287844258021376/1135662233460949002)
- [NynrahGhost's VotV_ghostmapping](https://github.com/NynrahGhost/VotV_ghostmapping/releases)
  - Included with later versions of VoidMod2 development kit with compatibility tweaks.
  - Incredible resource for creating actors or understanding how certain objects work.

## Save Slots

- [SaveEditOnline](https://www.saveeditonline.com/)
  - Not perfect, but the best we have until a Save Editor Mod is released. Edits the `.sav` files in `%localappdata%\VotV\Saved\SaveGames`

## Asset Viewing

:::note Editor's Note - On Datamining Assets
Please avoid attempting to Datamine new features with intent to distribute secrets. You WILL be banned or have posts deleted. Voices of the Void is a game about discovering the secrets and solving mysteries. Datamining ruins the fun and overall takes away from the experience for everyone.

PLEASE, only use these tools with intent to create 'Ghost References' for your Mods. I'd hate to see you ruin Nose's incredible game
:::

- [FModel](https://fmodel.app/)
  - Your best friend for Modding. Generates JSON summaries of assets' functions, variables, components, and allows you to export most assets.
- [Kismet Analyzer](https://github.com/trumank/kismet-analyzer)
  - Basically takes the JSON summaries that FModel creates and attempts to construct a graph. Useful for reversing Blueprints.
- [UModel/UE Viewer](https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel)
  - Though mostly obsolete compared to the other tools, UModel allows you to extract certain Textures, Sounds, and Models.
- [Stove](https://github.com/bananaturtlesandwich/stove)
  - Apparently a tool designed to view cooked Unreal Engine scenes. Have yet to test this with Voices of the Void.

## Blender

- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
  - Blender is a common 3D-Modeling and Rendering Program
- [PSK/PSA Importer](https://github.com/DarklightGames/io_scene_psk_psa)
  - Useful Plugin for Blender to help with importing certain assets
