# OLD Tutorial Video (v1.x.x)
:::warning
This is a tutorial video recorded by Gato (creepycats) and uploaded by CleaningLynx for VoidMod v1.X.X

I highly recommend you watch this, but DO NOT follow along to the Blueprints as VoidMod2 completely rewrites the functions shown in the video to be separate from the VoidMod instance.
:::
Please consider watching the Tutorial despite its out of date Blueprint instruction. This tutorial covers the Blueprints only and how to create your ModActor. Packaging, Material Troubleshooting, and more is covered in the Video Tutorial.

VoidMod2 also comes with a README file including a rundown of EVERYTHING you need to know. This tutorial is meant to explain the bare bones basics and differences.

You are also expected to know how to use Unreal Engine's Blueprint Editor, and understand concepts such as Event Tick, Event PostBeginPlay, Parent Classes, and Function Overrides
