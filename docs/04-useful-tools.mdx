# Useful Tools for Modding

## General Modding
- [RE-UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS)
  - Enables modding for Unreal Engine games, and provides many tools for modding and inspecting game functions. Check its [documentation here](https://docs.ue4ss.com/release/).
- [Unreal Shimloader](https://thunderstore.io/c/voices-of-the-void/p/Thunderstore/unreal_shimloader/)
  - A fork of RE-UE4SS designed by Thunderstore, designed to support Mod Managers and Custom Mod Paths.
- [VoidMod](https://thunderstore.io/c/voices-of-the-void/p/Gatohost/VoidMod/)
  - A blueprint framework mod, allowing for simple custom Props, Events, and interacting with the Base game.
  - You can download the VoidMod Development Kit (A .zip archive of Unreal Engine Assets containing the framework and examples, with ghostmappings included) in the [EternityDev Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/eternitydevgames), under the [VoidMod Loader Thread](https://discord.com/channels/512287844258021376/1135662233460949002).
- [modestimpala's VotV_ghostmapping](https://github.com/modestimpala/VotV_ghostmapping)
  - Empty UE4 assets created to mimic VotV's assets, allowing modders to reference VotV's objects in-game.
  - An incredible resource for creating actors or understanding how certain objects work.

## Save Slots
- [SaveEditOnline](https://www.saveeditonline.com/)
  - Not perfect, but the best we have until a Save Editor Mod is released. Edits the `.sav` files in `%localappdata%\VotV\Saved\SaveGames`

## Asset Viewing
:::note Editor's Note on Datamining Assets
<u>Do not</u> attempt to datamine the game with the intent to discover and spoil secrets. You **WILL** be banned and have your posts deleted. Voices of the Void is a game about discovering the secrets and solving mysteries. Datamining takes away from the fun and ruins the experience for everyone, including the developers.
:::

- [FModel](https://fmodel.app/)
  - Your best friend for Modding. Generates the raw JSON of assets' functions, variables, components, and allows you to view and export most assets.
- [Kismet Analyzer](https://github.com/trumank/kismet-analyzer)
  - Can take JSON summaries that FModel creates and attempts to construct a rudimentary graph. Useful for reversing Blueprints.
- [UModel/UE Viewer](https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel)
  - Though mostly obsolete compared to the other tools, UModel allows you to extract certain Textures, Sounds, and Models.
- [Stove](https://github.com/bananaturtlesandwich/stove)
  - A tool designed to view cooked Unreal Engine maps. Can be used with VotV with relative success.

## Blender
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
  - Blender is a common 3D-Modeling and Rendering Program.
- [PSK/PSA Importer](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/io-scene-psk-psa/) ([github](https://github.com/DarklightGames/io_scene_psk_psa))
  - A useful Plugin for Blender to help with importing assets exported through FModel.
