# Adding Input Events
Fusion allows you to insert input events that are created in Unreal Engine into VotV.

Importantly, **this functionality works together with the [keybinds datatable](./modifying-datatables) to create fully-integrated keybinds in VotV**. A fully-integrated keybind will be triggered when the player presses the key, but also appears in the keybinds section of the settings menu, can be rebound, is saved when the game is closed, and more.

## the process~
Start by opening your Project Settings in your Unreal project. In the sidebar, look for the "Engine" section, then look for the "Input" tab.
