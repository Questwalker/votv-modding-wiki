# Publishing To Thunderstore
VotV mods can be packaged to work with Thunderstore, as it allows streamlined mod installation as well as cross-version support. Thunderstore mods packages use the UnrealShimloader package format.

## Folder Format
A typical `.zip` file for Thunderstore may look like this. The files `icon.png`, `README.md`, and `manifest.json` are **required**, while all other files and folders are optional.\
Additionally, if you are including a `.lua` or `.dll` file in your mod, an `enabled.txt` is also required in the mod folder (it can be blank, it just needs to exist).
```
🗂️ MOD_AUTHOR-MOD_NAME-#.#.#.zip
    📄 manifest.json
    📄 README.md
    📄 CHANGELOG.md
    🖼️ icon.png
    📁 mod
        📄 enabled.txt
        📁 scripts
            📄 main.lua
        📁 dll
            📄 main.dll
    📁 pak
        📄 MOD_NAME.pak
    📁 cfg
        📄 MOD_AUTHOR-MOD_NAME-cfg.json
```

## The Manifest
The `manifest.json` is a file that contains information about your mod to be included on your Thunderstore mod page. The file is a `.json` file that contains the following values:

| Key            | Description                                                                                                  | Example value                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name           | Name of the mod page, with no spaces.<br/>Allowed characters: `a-z A-Z 0-9 _`                                | <pre>"Some_Mod"</pre>                                                                           |
| description    | A short description of the mod, shown on the mod list. Max 250 characters.                                   | <pre>"Hello world"</pre>                                                                        |
| version_number | Version number of the mod, following the [semantic version format](https://semver.org/) `Major.Minor.Patch`  | <pre>"1.3.2"</pre>                                                                              |
| dependencies   | List of other packages that are required for this package to function.                                       | <pre>[<br/>    "MythicManiac-TestMod-1.1.0",<br/>    "SomeAuthor-SomePackage-1.0.0"<br/>]</pre> |
| website_url    | URL of the mod's website (e.g. GitHub repo). Can be an empty string.                                         | <pre>"https:<area/>//example.com/"</pre>                                                        |

For example, a `manifest.json` might look like this:
```
{
    "name": "TestMod",
    "version_number": "1.1.0",
    "website_url": "https://github.com/thunderstore-io",
    "description": "This is a description for a mod. 250 characters max",
    "dependencies": [
        "MythicManiac-TestMod-1.1.0"
    ]
}
```
